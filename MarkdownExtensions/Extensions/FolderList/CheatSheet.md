# Folder list
Use a Markdown list to specify a folder structure. The folder is then rendered

```folder
- [root]
	- [subfolder]
		- [subfolder on yet another level]
			- which can have also files.txt
	- file
	- file.withextension
```

The root can be anything:
```folder
- [MyFolderName]
	- file.txt
```
